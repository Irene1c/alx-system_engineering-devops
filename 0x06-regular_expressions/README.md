# Regular expressions

* For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.
* Ruby code that you should use is, `puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join`
* Just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the `//`
